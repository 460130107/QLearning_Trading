Trading Using Q-Learning
==================

In this project, I will will use reinforcement learning framework to train an agent to trade. This project is part of the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) program, from Udacity. You can check my report <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> and the notebook with the tests of the codes used in this project <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. The TEX file was produced with help of [Overleaf]().
