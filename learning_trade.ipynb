    "*In this project, I will present an adaptive learning model to trade a single stock under the reinforcement learning framework. This area of machine learning consists in training an agent by reward and punishment without needing to specify the expected action. The agent learns from its experience and develops a strategy that maximizes its profits. \"The simulation results show initial success in bringing learning techniques to build algorithmic trading strategies\".[to be checked]*"

    "- Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?\n",
    "- Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?\n",

    "Nowadays, algo trading represents almost half of all cash equity trading in western Europe. In advanced markets, it already [accounts](http://en.resenhadabolsa.com.br/portfolio-category/the-distributionintermediation-industry-in-brazil-challenges-and-trends/) for over 40%-50% of total volume. In Brazil its market share is not as large – currently about 10% – but is expected to rise in the years ahead as markets and players go digital.\n",

    "As automated strategies are becoming increasingly popular, building an intelligent system that can trade many times a day and adapts itself to the market conditions and still consistently makes money is a subject of keen interest of any market participant.\n",

    "Given that it is hard to produce such strategy, in this project I will try to build an algorithm that just does better than a random agent, but learns by itself how to trade. To do so, I will feed my agent with one month of information about every trade and change in the [top of the order book](https://goo.gl/k1dDYZ) in the [PETR4](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrobras) - one of the most liquidity assets in Brazilian Stock Market - in a Reinforcement Learning Framework. Later on, I will test what it has learned in a newest dataset.\n",

    "In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be for this problem. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?\n",

    "[Algo trading](http://goo.gl/b9jAqE) strategies usually are programs that follow a predefined set of instructions to place its orders. The primary challenge to this approach is building these rules in a way that it can consistently generate profit without being too sensitive to market conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the goal of this project is to develop an adaptative learning model that can learn by itself those rules and trade a particular asset using reinforcement learning framework under an environment that replays historical high-frequency data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As \\cite{chan2001electronic} describe, reinforcement learning can be considered as a model-free approximation of dynamic programming. The knowledge of the underlying processes is not assumed but learned from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can access some information about the environment state as the order flow imbalance, the sizes of the best bid and offer and so on. At each time step $t$, It should generate some valid action, as buy stocks or insert a limit order at the Ask side. All inputs and actions will be detailed in the next sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent also should receive a reward or a penalty at each time step if it is already carrying a position from previous rounds or if it has made a trade (the cost of the operations are computed as a penalty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the rewards and penalties it gets, the agent should learn an optimal policy for trade this particular stock, maximizing the profit it receives from its actions and resulting positions.\n",

    "In 1988, the Wall Street Journal created a [Dartboard Contest](http://www.automaticfinances.com/monkey-stock-picking/), where Journal staffers threw darts at a stock table to select their assets, while investment experts picked their own stocks. After six months, they compared the results of the two methods. After adjusting the results to risk level, they found out that the pros barely have beaten the random pickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, the metric used to measure the performance of the learner will be the amount of money made by a random agent. So, my goal will be to outperform this agent, that should just produce some random action at each time $t$, such that:\n",

    "$$a_t \\in \\left (None,\\, buy,\\, sell,\\, best\\_bid,\\, best\\_ask,\\, best\\_both \\right)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The random agent is also limited to hold an open position of $400$ stocks at most, on any side. When it reaches its limit, it will be allowed just to perform actions that decrease its position. So, for instance, if it already [long](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) in $400$ shares, the possible moves would be $\\left (None,\\, sell,\\, best\\_ask \\right)$. If it is [short](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp), it just can perfrom $\\left (None,\\, buy,\\, best\\_bid\\right)$."
